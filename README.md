pnpm add @crowdstrike/graphics-core
# or
yarn add @crowdstrike/graphics-core
# or
npm install @crowdstrike/graphics-core
```

## Usage

To illustrate different use cases of the library, this repository includes the `test-app` folder; inside it are some demos as well as the package's test suite.

## Support

`@crowdstrike/graphics-core` is an open source project, not a CrowdStrike product. As such, it carries no formal support, expressed or implied.
